            Would it be possible for you to make a standalone testcase with only the code necessary to reproduce the issue?

            Stand-alone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unnecessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.

            Now adding the `blocked/need-repro` label for this reason. After you make a test case, please link to it in a followup comment. This issue will be closed in 10 days if the above is not addressed.
